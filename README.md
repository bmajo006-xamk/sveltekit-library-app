# Library check-out and return app

The project has developed as part of my studies. 
An application implemented using Svelte/SvelteKit/Prisma/sql technologies, allowing users to borrow and return library books. 
Borrowing functions require user authentication, achieved by entering the library card number. 
After borrowing, the user can view the borrowed items and their due dates. Returning the books do not require separate login. 
The application also allows users to view and edit their personal information and overdue fines, with this functionality requiring authentication.
The data for the application is sourced from its own database.

Screenshots directory contains few screenshots of the application running.
